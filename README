Minimal unix API compatibility library for win32
This library is distributed under the GNU LGPL version 2.1, which can be found
in the file "COPYING".
This license allows you to use libunix freely in commercial programs as long as
you link with the dynamic library.

Purpose
=======
Provide a minimal set of unix-compatible primitives 
(sockets, pthreads, mutexes, pipes, ...)
to native win32 applications compiled with Mingw32.
Much of the missing APIs are wrapping native win32 primitives 
(winsock functions, CreateThread, CreateMutex, etc...)

Tests
====

test : tests sockets, pthreads and pipes (select)
pipe : tests pthreads and pipes (select)
torture : exercises various error codes
err : given errno, quickly returns corresponding strerror(errno)
misc : tests miscellaneous things : sleep

Note
----
There is a minor inconsistency with pthread_self() and pthread_t;
Current implementation differs from POSIX in that threadid in win32 are different
between caller and callee.
This is because caller gets a handle to the thread, and callee can only get its thread id.
So one can't compare directly caller's handle and callee's pthread_self()'s result.
This is a minor bug, though.
